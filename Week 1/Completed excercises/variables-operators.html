    // EXERCISE 1:
    // Create a variable to hold the user input from a prompt which asks "What is your favorite food?"

    // console.log this sentence into the console:
    // "My favorite food is -----." using the answer from the prompt

    const favouriteFood = prompt("What is your favourite food?")

    console.log(`My favourite food is ${favouriteFood}`)

    // EXERCISE 2:
    // Create a variable with the starting value of 0. We will use it to count cookies!
    // Add 1 to the current value of that variable,
    let numberOfCookies = 0
    // Log this sentence into the console:
    // "I baked a cookie. Now I have -- cookie."
    numberOfCookies = numberOfCookies + 1
    console.log(`I baked a cookie. Now I have ${numberOfCookies}`)
    // Subtract 1 from the current value of the variable,
    // then (once again) re-assign the new value to the same variable.
    numberOfCookies = numberOfCookies - 1
    console.log(`I just ate a cookie. Now I have ${numberOfCookies} left`)
    // Log this sentence into the console:
    // "I just ate a cookie. Now I have -- cookies left."
    
    const random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1;
    numberOfCookies = numberOfCookies + random;
    console.log(`I was given a random amount of cookies, I now have ${numberOfCookies} cookies!`);

    // EXERCISE 3
    // BONUS: HINT: Google how to generate a random number in JS
    // we were given a random box of cookies!
    // Create a variable that holds a random number between 1 and 100.
    // add that new number to the cookie count and log this sentence into the console "I was given a random amount of cookies, I now have -- cookies!"
