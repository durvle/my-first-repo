// Exercise 1:

const song = {
	title:"Sinner's Prayer",
	artist:"Raphael Saadiq",
	album:"Jimmy Lee",

	function printSongDetails(song) {
		console.log(`${song.artist} released ${song.title} on the album ${song.album}`)
	}
	printSongDetails(song);
// Exercise 2:

// Create a person object with name and age properties and write a function called birthdayGreeting that takes the person object as an argument and returns the following string when the person turns a year older: "Happy birthday (name)! You are now (new age) years old!". Console.log the string.

const person = {
	name: "Dave",
	age: 37

// Exercise 3:
