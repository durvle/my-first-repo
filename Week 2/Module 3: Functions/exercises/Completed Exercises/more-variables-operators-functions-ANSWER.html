		//EXERCISE 1
		// 1. Ask the user for their age.
		// 2. Store the answer and convert their age into dog years by multiplying their age by 7.
		// 3. Console log the string: If you were a dog you'd be --- years old.
		const age = prompt("What's your age in years?");
		const ageInDogYears = age * 7;
		console.log(`If you were a dog you'd be ${ageInDogYears} years old`);

		//EXERCISE 2
		// 1. Create a variable that stores the price for an item in your store.
		// 2. Ask the user for the quantity of that item they would like to purchase.
		// 3. Calculate the tax on the purchase.
		// 4. Console log the string: The total cost of your purchase is $---
		// Bonus points if you can get it to show 2 decimals. (Google it!)
		const unicornPrice = 9.99;
		const quantity = prompt(`A unicorn costs $${unicornPrice}. How many unicorns would you like to purchase?`);
		const priceBeforeTax = unicornPrice * quantity;
		const salesTax = 0.13;
		const priceWithTax = priceBeforeTax + (priceBeforeTax * salesTax);
		const roundedPrice = priceWithTax.toFixed(2);
		console.log(`The total cost of your purchase is $${roundedPrice}`);

		// EXERCISE 3
		//1. Create 3 variables that store user inputted values from a prompt.
		//2. Use a built in JavaScript function to find the maximum of the three variables.
		//3. Log the answer into the console using the sentence: The maximum number is --.
		const num1 = prompt("First number");
		const num2 = prompt("Second number");
		const num3 = prompt("Third number");
		const maxNumber = Math.max(num1, num2, num3);
		console.log(`The maximum number is ${maxNumber}.`);

		// EXERCISE 4
		// 1. Ask the user for their name.
		// 2. Use a built in function to convert their name to lowercase characters and store it in a new variable.
		// 3. Use a built in function to convert their name to uppercase characters and store it in a new variable.
		// 4. Console log both strings in the same line.
		// Hint: Look into JavaScript String Methods
		const name = prompt("Hey! What's your name?");
		const lowerCaseName = name.toLowerCase();
		const upperCaseName = name.toUpperCase();
		console.log(lowerCaseName, upperCaseName);

		// EXERCISE 5
		// 1. Write some code that mimics a dice roll
		// 2. Console log the sentence: You rolled a ----!
		// Hint look into Math.random and Math.floor
		// Bonus points if you write a function to call from the console so you can roll the dice multiple times without refreshing the page.
		const roll = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1;
		console.log(`You rolled a ${roll}!`);

		// Bonus:

		function getDiceRoll() {
			const roll = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1;
			console.log(`You rolled a ${roll}!`);
