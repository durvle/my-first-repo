		// For the exercises below, try writing some pseudocode to help you break down the tasks more if needed.

		// EXERCISE 1
		// 1. Ask the user for their age.
		// 2. Store the answer and convert their age into dog years by multiplying their age by 7.
		// 3. Console log the string: If you were a dog you'd be --- years old.

		const yourAge = prompt("What is your age?")
			const dogAge = (yourAge * 7);
			console.log(`If you were a dog you'd be ${dogAge}`)
		
		
		
		//EXERCISE 2
		// 1. Create a variable that stores the price for an item in your store.
		// 2. Ask the user for the quantity of that item they would like to purchase.
		// 3. Calculate the tax on the purchase.
		// 4. Console log the string: The total cost of your purchase is $---
		// Bonus points if you can get it to show 2 decimals. (Google it!)
		let priceOfPaper = 17.59
		let userQuantity = prompt("How many would you like to purchase today?");
		const priceBeforeTax = priceOfPaper*userQuantity
		const tax = 0.13
		const priceAfterTax = priceBeforeTax + (priceBeforeTax*tax)
		let roundedTotal = priceAfterTax.toFixed(2);
		console.log(`The total cost of your purchase is ${roundedTotal}`)


		// const calculatePrice = (quantity, price, tax) => {
		// 	return totalCost = ((quantity * price)* tax);
			
		// }

		// const myTotal = calculatePrice(5.00, 7, 1.13);

		// console.log(myTotal);
		

	// 	function calculateBill(price){
    //     function calculateTax(singlePrice){
    //         return singlePrice * 1.13
    //     };
    //     return calculateTax(price);
    // }
	// console.log(calculateBill(100))
	
		// EXERCISE 3
		//1. Create 3 variables that store user inputted values from a prompt.
		//2. Use a built in JavaScript function to find the maximum of the three variables.
		//3. Log the answer into the console using the sentence: The maximum number is --.

		let age = prompt("What is your age?");
		let height = prompt("What is your height?");
		let weight = prompt("How much do you weigh?")
		const maxNumber = Math.max(age, height, weight)
		
		console.log(`The maximum number is ${maxNumber}`)

 		// EXERCISE 4
		// 1. Ask the user for their name.
		// 2. Use a built in function to convert their name to lowercase characters and store it in a new variable.
		// 3. Use a built in function to convert their name to uppercase characters and store it in a new variable.
		// 4. Console log both strings in the same line.
		// Hint: Look into JavaScript String Methods

		const userName = prompt("What is your name?")
		nameLowerCase = userName.toLowerCase()
		nameUpperCase = userName.toUpperCase()
		
		console.log(nameLowerCase, nameUpperCase)
    	// EXERCISE 5
    	// 1. Write some code that mimics a dice roll
    	// 2. Console log the sentence: You rolled a ----!
    	// Hint look into Math.random and Math.floor
    	// Bonus points if you write a function to call from the console so you can roll the dice multiple times without refreshing the page.

		// let rollDice = Math.floor(Math.random()* 12) + 1;
		// 	console.log(`You rolled a ${rollDice}`)
		
			function diceRoll() {
			const rollDice = Math.floor(Math.random() * 12) + 1;
			console.log(`You rolled a ${rollDice}!`);
		}
